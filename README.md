# Shift Markets Coding Challenge

## Setting up

* `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
* `npm run start:dev`
* open up `localhost:3000` in a web browser

The `run start:dev` command will run both the `webpack` process (in watch mode)to build your client-side javascript files, and the Node process for your server with `nodemon`.

* also deployed to Heroku: `https://catalytic-challenge-btam.herokuapp.com/`
* also created tests, which can be run with `npm run test`
